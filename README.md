# ShakeRattleRoll
Swift - Shake Rattle and Roll

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

This is a shake gesture game app you could use on your iOS device. All a player needs to do is just click on the 
'Shake Rattle and Roll' icon and they are taken right into the app. The first thing you see is the title on top 
'Shake Rattle And Roll'. Followed by the time limit, which is 10 seconds. Then in the middle is the happy flower in all its
glory smiling away. Right below that is the score, default 0. Then the 'Start Game' Button on the bottom. The background is 
a faded yellow color style.

As the player clicks the 'Start Game' Button, it is faded out with the text 'Shake Me Now' displayed. Now the player needs
to shake the device and the flower will animated as you shake with the score adding 1 point for each shake. The clock starts
to count down from 10 to 0. Once the game is over no more points are possible. If the player wants to play again all they
need to go is click the button on the bottom which is now labeled 'Restart' to start the game over from the beginning.
Its a fun game for all ages to try and see how many points can they rack up against other people.
